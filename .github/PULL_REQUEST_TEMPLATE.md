## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.

2. If not, then make sure that:

  a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes.
  Good examples are: `fix/ploting-issue` or `feature/quadradic-interpolation`.

    b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

    c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

    d. `pytest` doesn't throw any errors. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

    a. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

    b. Provide a description of your changes.


IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
