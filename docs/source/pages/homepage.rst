`spike2py`_ provides a simple interface to analyse and visualise data collected using `Spike2`_ software and `Cambridge Electronics Design (CED)`_ data acquisition boards. With it you can easily plot individual channels or all channels from a given trial. In addition, you can easily apply various signal processing methods to your `waveform` data. Finally, you can easily save your data at any point, allowing you to re-open and continue your work from where they left off.
